### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Mehdi Sakout, a Product Maker from Morocco, I am passionate about bringing ideas to life. I mainly test, code, launch and ship.
During the day Iâ€™m a Senior Android Engineer working at Elbotola Media, the #1 Sports app in the MENA region and an indie maker by night.
I do also contribute to open source whenever time allows it.
